All actions are eligible for MacOS

1) Install Homebrew

Open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. 
Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment 
variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH
```

brew install python
```

3) Install VirtualEnv
